# Getting started

Deploying to docs.guidewire.com provides the following benefits:

import Benefits from '@site/docs/_benefits.mdx';

<Benefits />

Not convinced? Look at [deploying to Atmos](./deploy-to-atmos.mdx) without using
a Guidewire theme. You can still use the Redoc plugin.

## Create a new Docusaurus site

If you don't have a project set up yet, you can create a new Docusaurus site.
Otherwise, you can skip this step.

Run this command to create a Docusaurus site:

```bash
yarn create docusaurus
```

If you want to read more about creating Docusaurus sites, look at
[the instructions on the official Docusaurus site](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation).

> :warning: Default package manager suggested by Docusaurus is `npx`. Do not run
> commands in `npx` or `npm` since it can cause problems later on. Stick to the
> `yarn` command provided above.

## Install required tools

### Node.js

Node.js version 18.0 or above is required. Your current version of Node.js can
be checked by running `node -v`. If this is your first time using Node.js, you
can install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Yarn 3

Using Yarn version 3 or above is required. Follow the steps below to set up Yarn
on your machine.

1. If you don't have Yarn, install it by following instructions in the
   [official documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
2. Go to your working directory (e.q. `website` in Docusaurus) and set Yarn to
   latest.

   ```bash
   yarn set version berry --yarn-path
   ```

   This adds the `.yarn` folder and `.yarnrc.yml` file to your repo.

3. Add the recommended files to `.gitignore`:

   ```git title=".gitignore"
   .pnp.*
   .yarn/*
   !.yarn/patches
   !.yarn/plugins
   !.yarn/releases
   !.yarn/sdks
   !.yarn/versions
   ```

4. In your `.yarnrc.yml` file, after `yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-3.X.X.cjs`,
   add:

   ```js yaml title=".yarnrc.yml"
   nodeLinker: node-modules
   npmAlwaysAuth: true
   npmAuthToken: ${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}
   npmScopes:
     doctools:
       npmRegistryServer: https://artifactory.guidewire.com/artifactory/api/npm/doctools-npm-dev/
   ```

5. If you have a `yarn.lock` generated with a previous version of Yarn, **delete
   it**.
6. Run `yarn` to install dependencies and update `yarn.lock`.

### React 18

Using React 18 or above is advised. Using React 17 is possible, but we have a
history of errors using React 17. If you come across errors regarding
`jsx-runtime` during build time, the solution might be updating to React 18.

To upgrade to React 18, please follow
[React 18 upgrade guide](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide) from their documentation.

## Set up access to the @doctools scope in Artifactory (first time only)

import Artifactory from './_set-up-artifactory.mdx';

<Artifactory />

## Configure your project

### trailingSlash

import { RightWrong, Right, Wrong } from '@theme/RightWrong';

<RightWrong>
<Right>

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
trailingSlash: true,
```

</Right>
<Wrong>

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
trailingSlash: false,
```

</Wrong>
</RightWrong>

Do not use this setting when posting to docs.guidewire.com. It breaks S3 file
hosting. Leave `trailingSlash` undefined, or set it to `true`. If
`trailingSlash` is not defined in your settings, there is no need to add it, as
it defaults to `true`.

### Add Guidewire theme/plugin

- [See set up instructions for the theme](./Themes/Classic/set-up-theme.mdx).
- [See set up instructions for the plugin](./Plugins/Redoc/set-up-plugin.mdx).

## Extend your build pipeline

Deployments to docs.guidewire.com run the following commands:

```sh
yarn
yarn build
```

And then they upload the generated files to an S3 bucket.

If you want your site to perform complex steps before publishing, for example
fetch data from an API or build docs from code, we suggest you follow one of
these approaches:

- Add steps to the build command. This means your custom steps run every time
  the site is built. For example:
  ```json title="package.json"
  "my-build": "node someScript.js && python some_program.py",
  "build": "yarn my-build && docusaurus build",
  ```
- Maintain your own pipeline of Teamcity builds which generate docs and commit
  them into your documentation repo. You control when each build is run, for
  example on release, or on various triggers from different repos.
