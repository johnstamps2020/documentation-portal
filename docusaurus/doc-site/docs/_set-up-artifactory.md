To work on your documentation project locally, you need an environment variable
called `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` that contains an identity token for accessing
Artifactory. Documentation builds in TeamCity use a token generated for the
Artifactory service account that is maintained by the ContentOps team.

To configure the environment variable on your machine:

1. From your [Okta home](https://guidewire.okta.com/app/UserHome), log into
   Artifactory.
2. In the top right-hand corner, click your username and select **Edit
   profile**.
3. Either copy an existing token, or click **Generate an identity token** and
   copy that.
4. Set the value of the NPM_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable to the token that
   you copied from Artifactory.
5. If necessary, restart your terminal.
