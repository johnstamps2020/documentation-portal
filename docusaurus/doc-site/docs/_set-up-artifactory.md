You need an environment variable called `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`.

To get the token:

1. From your Okta home, log into Artifactory.
1. In the top right-hand corner, click your username and select **Edit
   profile**.
1. Either copy an existing token, or click **Generate and identity token** and
   copy that.
1. Set the token as the value of an environment variable called
   `NPM_AUTH_TOKEN`.
1. Restart your terminal, if necessary.
