# Internal page

import Note from './_internal-not-secure.mdx';

<Note />

You can make an entire page internal. To users without a Guidewire email, the
page is not visible in the left nav. If they get a link to that page, they see a
page which tell them they don't have access, along with some guidance.

To make a page internal, add the `internal: true` anywhere in the MDX prolog.
Other props work normally.

```md {2}
---
internal: true
sidebar_position: 2
sidebar_label: Easy
sidebar_class_name: green
...and other props, as needed

# My private page

I don't want anyone to see my page so I am making it internal.
```
