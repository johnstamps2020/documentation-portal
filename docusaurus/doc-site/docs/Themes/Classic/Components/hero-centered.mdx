The `HeroCentered` component is a simple component that centers its children
vertically and horizontally. It is useful for creating hero sections.

<HeroCentered additionalStyles={{ my: '3rem' }}>
  <div>
    <p style={{ marginBottom: 0 }}>Jutro DS</p>

`HeroCentered` renders two divs. The external one is a flex container that
centers its children vertically and horizontally. The internal one is a flex
container that stacks its children vertically.

`HeroCentered` accepts a `additionalStyles` prop that can be used to add
additional styles to inner div. The prop is a MUI `sx` prop, so it accepts
complex MUI styles. In the example above, we used `my: '3rem'` which adds
vertical margin, or "margin on the Y-axis".
