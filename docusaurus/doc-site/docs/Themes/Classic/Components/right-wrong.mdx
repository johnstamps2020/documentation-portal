# RightWrong

import { RightWrong, Right, Wrong } from '@theme/RightWrong';

This component displays the right and the wrong option.

```jsx
import { RightWrong, Right, Wrong } from '@theme/RightWrong';
```

The most basic usage is as follows.

```jsx live
<RightWrong>
  <Right>Thank the bus driver</Right>
  <Wrong>Ignore the bus driver</Wrong>
</RightWrong>
```

## Custom title

You can also override the text displayed next to the icon using the `title`
prop.

```jsx live
<RightWrong>
  <Right title="Polite">Thank the bus driver</Right>
  <Wrong title="Impolite">Ignore the bus driver</Wrong>
</RightWrong>
```

## Rich text

In MDX, you can use Markdown syntax inside a JSX tag. Keep in mind to maintain
the correct indentation, as improper indentation can lead to errors.

```mdx
<RightWrong>
  <Right title="Polite">
    - Talk to other passengers about the weather
    - Thank the bus driver
    - Say "please" and "thank you"
  </Right>
  <Wrong title="Impolite">
    - Talk to the bus driver about the weather
    - Not thank the bus driver
    - Say "tell me what time it is" and "get that for me real quick, or else..."
  </Wrong>
</RightWrong>
```

<RightWrong>
