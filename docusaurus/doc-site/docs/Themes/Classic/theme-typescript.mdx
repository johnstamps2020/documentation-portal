# Theme Typescript support

If you are using Typescript in your site, you can import type definitions from
the theme by adding `types` to your `tsconfig.json`. Here's an example file set
up for this theme.

```json {5}
{
  "extends": "@tsconfig/docusaurus/tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "types": ["@doctools/gw-theme-classic"]
  }
}
```
