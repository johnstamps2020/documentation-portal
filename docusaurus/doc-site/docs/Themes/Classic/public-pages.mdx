# Public pages

You can make any page public. Users will be able to see the page without logging
in. In the MDX prolog, add the following prop:

```yaml
---
public: true
---
```

## Restricting a page in a public doc

See [restricted pages](./restricted-pages.mdx).

The entire doc will be public, but this page will be restricted.

## Making part of a page restricted

Unfortunately, you can't make part of a page restricted. If you need to do this,
you'll need to create a new page and make it restricted.

## Making part of a public page internal

Use [internal content](./Components/Internal/internal-content.md).
