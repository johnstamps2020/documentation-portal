# Set up gw-theme-classic

import ThemeWarning from '../../_do-not-use-theme.md';

<ThemeWarning />

This is the Guidewire theme for publishing Docusaurus sites to
docs.guidewire.com.

## Before you begin

Make sure you follow [the steps on our Getting started page](../../intro.md).

## Install

import ThemeCodeBlock from '@site/src/components/InstallationCodeBlock.tsx';

<ThemeCodeBlock />

The latest version of the theme is displayed above. For more versions, see
Artifactory.

## Set theme in docusaurus.config.js

At the root of your config, add:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
themes: ["@doctools/gw-theme-classic"],
```

## Set baseUrl (MANDATORY)

Docusaurus requires `baseUrl` when published to a sub-path in a domain. When
publishing to docs.guidewire.com, you can use the `BASE_URL` environment
variable to set it. This variable is present in the Documentation Portal project
in Teamcity.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
baseUrl: process.env["BASE_URL"] || "/",
```

## Navbar and logo

The navbar (top bar) is set so that it matches Guidewire styles and contains the
following:

- A logo that points to the root of the documentation site (not your site)
- A version selector which points to other versions of your site published to
  docs.guidewire.com
- A search box that uses site metadata to apply filters to your searches
- A log in/out button that checks user identity using the API available on
  docs.guidewire.com.
