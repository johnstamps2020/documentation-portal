# Site authors

When the feedback mechanism creates a Jira in response to a user clicking a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button, site author information is added to the jira if it exists. Site authors are email addresses that are added to the Jira as **Possible contacts**.
To add site authors:

1. Open `docusaurus.config.js`.
1. Within `module.exports` add a `customFields` object if one does not yet exist. If there already is a `customFields` object, proceed to the next step.
1. Add an `authors` array to `customFields`.
1. Add email addresses to the `authors` array.

For example:
```json
module.exports {
  ...
  customFields {
    authors: ['mgilster@guidewire.com', 'pkowaluk@gidewire.com']
  }
}
