# Public pages

When using the pluginVersions, you can make any of the pages public. Users will
be able to see the page without logging in. In the MDX prolog, add the following
prop:

```yaml
---
public: true
---
```

## Restricting a page in a public doc

See [restricted pages](./restricted-pages.mdx).

The entire doc will be public, but this page will be restricted.

## Making part of a page restricted

Unfortunately, you can't make part of a page restricted. If you need to do this,
you'll need to create a new page and make it restricted.

## Making part of a public page internal

Use
[internal content](../../Themes/Classic/Components/Internal/internal-content.mdx).
