# Migration assistance

![](./img/undraw_moving.svg)

The Doctools team can help you migrate your site from a custom deployment to the
documentation portal. The high-level steps are:

1. We apply the theme
1. We create deployments and other helpful builds for your project
1. We ask you what workflow you want to use for customer feedback
1. You can now delete your old site and start using the new one

## Theme

We create a PR with all the changes needed to apply the theme. At this point,
your validation builds may fail, so we will need you help merging the PR.

In case you don't know, the theme provides the following benefits:

import Benefits from '@site/docs/_benefits.md';

<Benefits />

## Deployments

We create deployments and other helpful builds for your project. Among other
things, you get handy validation builds which add a preview link to every PR.

To access preview builds, you need to be a member of the
`docportal-build-runners` group in AD. You can request your pod to be added by
opening a ticket in ServiceNow project.

## Feedback

Once of the features you get on the portal is feedback buttons. People can add
comments to your docs and those comments end up as Jira Action Items in the DOCS
project. We triage issues and assign them to the appropriate pods.

We will ask you what workflow you want to use for customer feedback.

- Should we add them to a specific project? Which one?
- Should we assign a specific person, apply a component, or something else.

## Your old site

At this point, out work is done. You can now delete your old site and start
using the new one. This also means you can delete your Atmos deployments,
gateway configs, Teamcity builds etc.

Aside from the nice feeling of of getting rid of clutter, this step is where you
save some money ðŸ’° on AWS and other services.

## Redirect service

If you want, you can keep the old URL for a while and redirect users to the new
site. This is a good idea if you have a lot of traffic and want to avoid
confusing users.

Explore our
[redirect service repository](https://stash.guidewire.com/projects/DOCTOOLS/repos/redirect-server/browse),
which contains all the necessary resources and code for implementing the
redirect service on your site. To get started, please follow the instructions
outlined in the ReadMe file. It provides step-by-step guidance on how to apply
the redirect service to your website, ensuring a smooth transition for your
visitors.
