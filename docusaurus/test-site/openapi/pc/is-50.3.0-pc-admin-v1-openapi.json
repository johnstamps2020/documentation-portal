        "description": "The fields parameter allows the caller to specify the set of fields that should be included for a given resource, and allows the client to avoid fetching fields they don't want as well as to request optional fields that aren't included by default.  The parameter is of the form fields=<field list> or fields=<include>:<field list>.  The <field list> is a comma-separated list of fields desired on the response, and <include> indicates that the field selection applies to an included resource.  If not specified, the default fields for a resource will be returned. The \"checksum\" and \"links\" properties are special and can be included by specifying \"$checksum\" and \"$links\" respectively. If you wish to select fields on the root resource and the included resources, each of those must be in a separate fields parameter. For example, ?fields=<field list>&fields=<include1>:<field list>&fields=<include2>:<field list>. Special values beginning with the '*' character are used to indicate a set of fields to return, which will then be combined with additional fields that are explicitly listed. The '*default' set will include whatever set of the fields the endpoint would normally return if the \"fields\" query parameter wasn't specified. For example, specifying fields=firstName,lastName will return only the firstName and lastName fields on the response, while specifying fields=default,firstName,lastName will return all the default fields as well as the firstName and lastName. Other '' options are '*detail', '*summary', and '*all'. Properties on sub-objects can be selected via dot-separated paths, for example fields=assignedUser,assignedUser.id will fetch only the id of the assignedUser object but not the displayName. <include> can also represent a nested included resource, such as fields=activities.notes:subject,body.",

Valid operators include \"eq\", \"ne\", \"lt\", \"gt\", \"le\", \"ge\", \"in\", \"ni\", \"sw\", and \"cn\". Values should be formatted according to the same JSON type and format as the filtered field, i.e. if the filtered field is a boolean field, the value should either be \"true\" or \"false\" and if the filtered field is a date-time field, the value should be an ISO-8601 date-time value.  One exception is that filtering on date-time fields can accept either date-times or dates. On occasions where the value needs to contain a \":\" character, this character can be escaped with an additional \":\". For example, to compare against \"some:value\", the query parameter would take the form <field>:<operator>:some::value.
