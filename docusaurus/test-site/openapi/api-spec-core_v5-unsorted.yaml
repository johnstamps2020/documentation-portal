        Normalizes, verifies, and provides a more complete address.
        Include as many address components as you can in the request (e.g. id, addrTypeCd, and addr1).
        The API normalizes the address components and may includes additional address properties.
        The response either returns one or more addresses that match the given address, or it will return an error if the address cannot be verified.
        - If more than one address is returned, select an address and then resubmit the API request to perform address verification on the selected address. The API will update the address components you included in the request ("normalizing" them) as well as fill in as many additional address properties as it can. As a result, you should generally recopy all properties of the response address (including the additional ones) into the entity that will ultimately contain the address (for example, an insured mailing address), even if you did not pass them to this API or even recognize them.
        - If more than one address is returned, the individual addresses may not be completely processed (for example, they may not have been geocoded). Choose one and call this API again with it to perform a full verification and get only one result.
