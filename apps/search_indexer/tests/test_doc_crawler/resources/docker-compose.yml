# We use an env for the network mode because for Linux agents in TeamCity we need to use the 'host' mode
# (the 'bridge' mode doesn't work in our test env on TeamCity agents).
# For running tests locally, for example on Mac with Docker Desktop, we need to use the 'bridge' mode
# (the 'host' mode works only on Linux).
