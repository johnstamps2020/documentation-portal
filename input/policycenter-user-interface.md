In most cases, when viewing a bound policy, the **Quote** screen displays the premium of the bound policy, regardless of the date.

If you enter this screen by selecting a policy transaction on the **Account File Policy Transactions** screen, PolicyCenter displays the policy transaction with the initial quote. If you change the date, PolicyCenter switches to a mode that displays the bound policy as of a certain date. In this mode, PolicyCenter displays the bound quote, whatever the date.
