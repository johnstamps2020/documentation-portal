<h1 class="title topictitle1" id="c_st4357327__st4357327">Automated assignment</h1>
<div class="body conbody">
    <p class="p">ClaimCenter uses business rules in the work’s global and/or group’s default assignment rule
      sets to determine how to assign an item automatically. These rules typically consider certain
      attributes of the item being assigned, the workload of each owner being considered, any
      special skills that are required, and more.</p>
    <p class="p">For example, a claim can be assigned to the members of a local group by using round-robin
      selection. Each adjuster has a balanced workload, or the claim can be assigned to a member of
      a specialty group that has experience with the particular type of loss. Automated assignment
      runs when the work is created, or when, while performing manual assignment, you choose the
        <span class="ph uicontrol">Use automated assignment</span> option.</p>
    <p class="p">There are four types of automated assignment: </p>
    <ul class="ul" id="c_st4357327__ul_hg2_h5z_cjb">
      <li class="li">Round-robin</li>
      <li class="li">Weighted workload</li>
      <li class="li">Assignment by location</li>
      <li class="li">Assignment by proximity</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="section" id="c_st4357327__RoundRobin"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Round-robin assignment</h2>Users in a group are assigned work
      in a cyclical fashion based on knowledge of past assignments and other defined criteria such
      as user attributes. The load and difficulty of the work assigned is not a factor. The purpose
      of round robin is to assign work at an equal rate. <p class="p">The following figure illustrates a
        round-robin example.</p><br /><img class="image" id="c_st4357327__image_ytn_1zl_1jb" src="round_robin_assignment.svg" width="464" height="428" alt="" /><br /><p class="p">Round robin assignment methods assign work sequentially to
        users in the group specified in the method. Round robin methods list the group’s users in
        order by user ID, remember the last user in the list to have been given a round robin
        assignment, and assign work to the next person on the list. The round robin list order is by
        user ID, which is based on the date a user account was created. Therefore, users created
        first are at the start of a round robin list and users created last are at the end. For
        example, a new adjuster that was just hired will be at the end of a round robin list because
        their user account was most recently created. Round robin assignment can be configured to
        either assign work only within a specific group, or, among a group and all its
        subgroups.</p><p class="p">Round robin assignment can in certain situations take
        into account a user’s load factor, but do not consider the load factor of users in other
        groups. A load factor is a proportional number representing the frequency of work to be
        assigned. For example, a load factor of 50 means a user is only assigned work half the
        time.</p><p class="p">Other round-robin assignment methods can use a set of
        criteria such as user attributes or user location to construct the set of potential
        assignees, which can span groups. The criteria, not group membership, are important. Load
        factors cannot be used with these methods. A round-robin assignment rule that uses
        attributes to assign work will first perform round-robin assignment among users with those
        attributes before assigning to other users. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="c_oc4644388.html#c_oc4644388">Custom user attributes</a>.</p></section>
    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Weighted workload</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Users in a group are assigned work based on the calculated weight that represents the
        complexity of their current assignments. The purpose of weighted workload is to ensure
        everyone has the same amount of work at any given time.</p>
      <p class="p">The following figure illustrates a weighted workload example.</p>
      <br /><img class="image" id="c_st4357327__image_x4k_czl_1jb" src="weighted_workload_assignment.svg" width="504" height="428" alt="Example of an object being assigned to Adjuster #2 because their total weight is 20, which is lower than the total weight for other adjusters." /><br />
      <p class="p">For more information on Weighted workload, see: <a class="xref" href="c_no1132992.html#c_no1132992">Weighted workload</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assignment by location</h2>
      
      <p class="p">You can assign work to users by matching on a user's street address or
        other location, such as an adjuster in a specific zip code or postal code. If a set of
        multiple users match on a specific location, assignment is performed by round-robin through
        the set of users in that location. Use this method if assignment is based on geographic
        ownership, such as auto appraisers located in a particular set of zip codes in a state. If
        no matching users are found, the item is assigned to the claim owner.</p>
      <p class="p">Assigning by location assumes that you have configured <span class="keyword">GenericCenter</span> to look for address elements. In the base configuration,
        this is first by zip code, second by county, and third by state. You may configure <span class="keyword">GenericCenter</span> to look for other non-United States address elements
        (such as Province or Postal Code), and chose the order to consider the elements
        accordingly.</p>
      <p class="p">This gives you more control over the lookup sequence, in order to have
        an order that matches your region settings and the likelihood of the data being available.
        You can also internationalize the lookup.</p>
      <div class="p">
        <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> <span class="keyword">GenericCenter</span> provides two options
          for assigning by location: manual and automated. The method described here is automated
          location assignment. This is not the same as the <span class="ph uicontrol">Search by location</span>
          and <span class="ph uicontrol">Search by distance from a location</span> radio buttons in the
          assignment screen. For more information on manual assignment, see <a class="xref" href="c_st4357320.html#c_st4357320">Manual assignment</a>.</div>

    </section>
    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Assignment by proximity</h2>Users in a group are assigned work based on a
      geographic region they are responsible for, such as a metropolitan area, jurisdiction, state,
      or province.<p class="p">User proximity to a certain geographical location can be used as one of the
        criteria for assignment. Proximity is an important factor in assigning often-performed,
        simple tasks. </p><p class="p">Some examples:</p><ul class="ul" id="c_st4357327__ul_jzx_gxy_cjb">
        <li class="li">You want to assign claims to adjusters who live or work near the loss site. </li>
        <li class="li">If the activity pattern is a vehicle inspection and the vehicle location is known,
          perform a proximity search and choose an activity owner by round-robin from the closest
          users.</li>
        <li class="li">If the policyholder is Spanish-speaking, find the closest Spanish-speaking adjusters,
          and chose a claim owner by using round-robin.</li>
        <li class="li">You can search for all preferred vendors, such as auto repair shops within five miles of
          the claim loss location who specialize in European cars. After retrieving a list of
          contacts that fit the criteria, you can use an assignment rule to add one of those
          contacts to a claim. </li>
        <li class="li">The user in the current group who is closest to a location you specify.</li>
        <li class="li">The closest user in the group and all its subgroups, and, if several users are
          approximately the same distance away, choose one by round-robin.</li>
        <li class="li">The user who best satisfies a pre-defined search criterion, such as <dfn class="term">within 10
            miles</dfn>, or <dfn class="term">no further than 50 kilometers</dfn> from a chosen location. This
          technique can also perform a round-robin selection of users within a similar distance of
          the chosen location.</li>
      </ul>
<div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> The difference between assignment by location and proximity is that proximity
        assignment uses a geocoding service to identify users in a radius worldwide. Location
        assignment only matches on a specific part of a United States address, such as a zip code or
        county. For more information, see:<ul class="ul" id="c_st4357327__ul_k42_yxy_cjb">

      <p class="p">It is often desirable to temporarily remove a user from receiving assignments by
        round-robin. ClaimCenter provides mechanisms for this.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">If the assignment method uses load factor to control assignment, set the user’s load
          factor to 0 by using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Administration</span> or
            <span class="keyword wintitle">Team</span> screen.</li>
        <li class="li">Set the user’s Vacation status to On Vacation (Inactive) so the user does not receive
          automated assignments. Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Administration</span> or
            <span class="keyword wintitle">Team</span> screen.</li>
        <li class="li">Choose <span class="ph uicontrol">Inactive</span> in the user’s User Profile. However, doing so
          also disables access to ClaimCenter, and the user receives no assignments at all by any
          means, not just round-robin.<p class="p">Note that the <span class="ph uicontrol">Inactive</span> status is
